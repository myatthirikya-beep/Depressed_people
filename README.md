## 🛠️ How to Run the Project (For the Teacher)

The database file is included in this repository, so mounting Google Drive is **not required**.

1.  **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click the link below to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

    > **👉 [https://colab.research.google.com/github/myatthirikya-beep/Depressed_people/blob/pair_project/Depressed_people.ipynb]**

2.  **Run the Setup Cell:** The very first code cell in the notebook must contain the necessary commands to **download the database file** from GitHub into the Colab environment using the direct "raw" link.

    
3.  **Execute All Cells:** Run the remaining cells sequentially to reproduce all data loading, analysis, and visualization steps.
