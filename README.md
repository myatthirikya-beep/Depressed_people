The database file is included in this repository, so mounting Google Drive is **not required**.

1.  **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click the link below to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

    > **👉 [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10X9yDazLB0BMY3Q-0CZsHeIjSI7xYTX0#scrollTo=D6cLvfcls8B8]**
    > *(Find this by navigating to `Depressed-people.ipynb` on GitHub and clicking the "Open in Colab" badge or icon.)*

2.  **Run the Setup Cell:** The very first code cell in the notebook must contain the necessary commands to **download the database file** from GitHub into the Colab environment using the direct "raw" link.

  
3.  **Execute All Cells:** Run the remaining cells sequentially to reproduce all data loading, analysis, and visualization steps.
